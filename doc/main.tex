\section{Part A}



\subsection{A.1}

In this section we refer to the defined metrics as $M1$, $M2$ and $M3$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{M1}: Geographic Proximity
    \item \textbf{M2}: Service Availability
    \item \textbf{M3}: Population Age Distribution
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Metric Specifications}\leavevmode


Here we'll be going through how the similarity metrics were defined and the related information.

\textbf{M1}: Used $Location$ feature from the excel sheets to approximate the location relative to the \textit{Melbourne General Post Office (GPO)}. The feature-value was parsed as: \newline
\textit{Xkm Y of Melbourne} $\rightarrow (X, Y) \rightarrow (X, compass\ bearing)$, with $Y \in \{\text{N}, \text{NNE}, \text{NE}, \text{ENE}, \dots,\text{NNW}\}$ and the corresponding bearings being in $\{0, 22.5, 45, 67.5,\dots, 337.5\}$.

Now, max distance of any suburb from our origin $O$ (Melbourne GPO) is 68km. So, maximum pairwise distance that can be is $2\times 68=136$ km. The curvature of the Earth causes a drop of around $1.45km$ [\href{https://earthcurvature.com/}{Calculator}] across this distance. As this is quite small, it's ignored and the entire region is treated as flat. We then convert $Polar$ to $Cartesian$ using the formula 

\[
x = r \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{180} \cdot \theta\right)
\]
\[
y = r \cdot \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{180} \cdot \theta\right)
\] [$y$ axis aligns with $0^\circ$, so $\sin$ and $\cos$ are swapped]. The goal is to check for physical proximity of the suburbs, using the $L^2$ norm.

\textbf{M2}: Each feature under the $Services$ catgory is considered and min-max scaled. Before Scaling StDev <Figure> and After Scaling StDev <Figure>. Afterwards, mean was taken across the scaled feature-values under the Services category per row (suburb by suburb), which is named as the $Services \ Score$ for that suburb. The distribution of is as such <Figure>. Similarity between suburbs from this perspective is defined as the absolute difference between the corresponding services' score. This is the pairwise similarity heatmap <Figure>. The aim is to quantify how well-equipped a suburb is in terms of the said facilities and to check for similar amount of services provided in other suburbs. However, some feature values like \textit{Aged Care (Low Care)} dominate over the others. Thus, scaling is required. 

\textbf{M3}: The \textit{2012 population} category was chosen and only the feature names with $\%$ were chosen, for example

$\{ \textit{2012 ERP age 0-4\%}, \textit{2012 ERP age 5-9\%}, \dots\}$. The feature values are then converted to probability distributions with range $[0,1]$, with each row summing up to 1 for each suburb (verified). For quantifying similarity between two locations we consider the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence}{Jensen Shannon Divergence}(JSD) between the two population distributions. This distance metric was chosen as we're essentially dealing with pmf's and because JSD is symmetric. The aim of this metric/perspective is to measure the similarity between the 2012 (latest) population distributions between two locations.
