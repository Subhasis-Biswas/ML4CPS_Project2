\subsubsection{Hospital Separations and City Population}

\textbf{Coefficient and Statistical Significance}
The population variable, \textit{``2012 ERP, total''}, shows a positive and statistically significant association with public hospital separations:
\[
\text{x\_coef} = 0.26826, \quad p = 0.0000.
\]
This suggests that hospital separations tend to increase proportionately with the total population.

\textbf{Spatial Autocorrelation}
The lag of the dependent variable indicates spatial dependence, meaning areas with higher separations are likely near other high-separation areas, possibly due to shared or regional factors in health demand:
\[
\text{y\_lag} = 0.61501, \quad p = 0.00112.
\]

\subsubsection{Population Density and Distance to Hospital}

\textbf{Coefficient and Statistical Significance}
Population density decreases significantly as the distance to the nearest hospital increases, suggesting a strong inverse relationship:
\[
\text{x\_coef} = -242.925, \quad p = 0.00030.
\]
This implies that areas further from hospitals have lower population density, which could indicate that hospitals are generally positioned closer to higher-density areas.

\textbf{Spatial Dependence}
Spatial autocorrelation is also present here, with a positive y-lag suggesting that population density in an area is similar to that of its neighboring regions:
\[
\text{y\_lag} = 0.60337, \quad p = 0.00179.
\]

\subsubsection{Emergency Department Load and Distance}

\textbf{Coefficient and Statistical Significance}
There is a significant negative association between the percentage of category 4 and 5 emergency department presentations (non-urgent visits) and the distance to the nearest hospital with an emergency department:
\[
\text{x\_coef} = -0.41756, \quad p = 0.01361.
\]
This suggests that populations closer to emergency facilities tend to use them more for non-urgent cases, likely indicating greater accessibility.

\textbf{Spatial Lag}
A strong spatial lag indicates that regions with high non-urgent visits influence similar behavior in neighboring regions, possibly driven by shared behavioral or accessibility factors:
\[
\text{y\_lag} = 0.75407, \quad p = 0.00000.
\]
